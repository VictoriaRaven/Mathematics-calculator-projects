## Copyright Usage and License

I have put a license for this repository as most CS "Calulators" are usally pre-coded beforehand (someone else already invented it). Other peers must also comply with the license. In the future I may modify this to include other additonal features for fun.

Please read [MIT license](LICENSE.md) for details on the license and what you can do with this code.

Other Math Calculator Projects to do in the future for fun:
-Do a code project for AL to calculate trig identities. (string perhaps)
-create double integral caculator/triple, 3d images, etc.
-calculator for bmi.
-caclulator for physics projectiles v=vo_at^2 etc...
