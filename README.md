# ViRaven

This repository is where I apply many of the coding languages I learned into projects I want to create or ideas.
If the project isn't under "projects" here it's because I didn't upload it there yet.
In most cases, there will be codes I make on my own here and unpublished/shared prjects here.

In the future I hope to try out projects publicly.

Do a code project for angie to calculate trig identities. (string perhaps)
